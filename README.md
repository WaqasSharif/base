- Run ` node -v ` in the terminal
-	npm (Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm.) Used to manage development dependencies.
-  Run ` npm -v`  in the terminal
-	Gulp â€“ task runner
	`npm install -g gulp`

- Navigate into the repo directory: `cd bootstrap-gulp-starter-template`

- Your site is now viewable at this URL: http://localhost:3000
- To create compressed, production-ready assets run `gulp production`. This will delete everything in the dist folder and recreate all of your complied files. Never make updates directly into the dist folder as these files get overridden each time.
