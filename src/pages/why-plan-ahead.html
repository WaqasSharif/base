Ensure your funeral or memorial service is the best reflection of who you are and celebrates your life in a way that matters. Do you want to be cremated instead of buried six feet under? Perhaps you want your service to skip all the sappy poems and scripture verses read at most funerals. This is your chance to make your final wishes known, giving you some control over how you’re remembered for all eternity.

You can make payments ahead of time or figure out which money from your estate or trust fund will be allocated toward your funeral costs. This also prevents your family from making as many impulsive decisions at the last minute, as grief can often cloud people’s best judgments. Perhaps you don’t want to spend eternity in that gold-glittered casket.

We’ll ensure your tribute reflects your unique lifestyle, personality, and budget. For example, if you were most proud of your military service, we’ll take special care to include military funeral honors during your ceremony, including a rendition of Taps and the presentation of a flag to your loved ones. If you were a collector of something, be sure to specify what parts of your collection you want to be displayed or buried with you.
