                                                    <p>Pre-planning is much like it sounds, it is making the decisions of how you would like to be remembered. It allows you to make your wishes known to your loved ones and gives you the opportunity to create a unique celebration...just how you would have wanted it. Pre-funding is the next logical step in the planning process. Your loved ones will greatly appreciate you pre-planning as it alleviates questions like "I'm not sure what he would have wanted". However, knowing your choices still leaves a financial burden for those left behind. Pre-funding allows you to pay for your funeral plans, saving loved ones from incurring those costs. There are several different options of pre-funding your funeral which our pre-arrangement specialists will guide you through.

                                                    <p>Yes. Our cremation facility is set up to allow family members to be present when the body is placed into the cremation chamber. In fact, some religious groups include this as part of their funeral custom. As anything, this is a personal choice on whether you want to witness this event.
