                                The most difficult decisions usually include what happens to your remains and your desired final resting place. You must first decide between a traditional casket burial or cremation. From an immediate burial without any type of service to an open casket with visitation and graveside services, there is no “one size fits all” funeral or memorial service. Every life is unique, and so are our end-of-life celebrations. Even if you choose cremation, you can still have a meaningful ceremony. Many families are bound by cultural or religious obligations. Our staff will do everything we can to accommodate your specific needs. If you’re having trouble deciding between cremation or burial, we can help you weigh the pros and cons.

                                Are you anxious about the rising costs of funerals? You’re not alone. Funeral pre-planning is all about giving you peace of mind. You may set up monthly payments now or arrange for one lump sum from your bank account or trust fund to pay for your funeral costs when the time comes. One of the biggest benefits of pre-planning is paying ahead and locking in the current funeral costs without worrying about future inflation. The money allocated for your funeral is also non-taxable. Most pre-arrangements are flexible and transferrable to other funeral homes should you move. The financial merits are just the tip of the iceberg.

We offer beautiful wood, marble, ceramic, and bronze options, as well as biodegradable ones for those preferring a green burial. Ashes can be placed in an urn vault or columbarium, or you could opt to have your ashes scattered in a peaceful place with permission.
