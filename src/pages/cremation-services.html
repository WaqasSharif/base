                                <p>Over the years, cremation has become an increasingly popular option. Offering flexibility on when and where the service can be held, this choice is convenient and customizable. You can have a traditional funeral service before cremation takes place or a memorial service at any time with or without the ashes present. If the ashes are present, you can have the urn buried in a grave or columbarium where we can hold a funeral service. You can also keep your loved ones' remains if you so choose. This way, the ashes can be kept or scattered in the loving memory of your friend or family member who has passed. No matter what you choose, we’re here to offer you a beautiful and meaningful ceremony.

We even offer biodegradable urns in a variety of styles to accommodate water burials and green cemeteries since they are designed to break down naturally over time. If you prefer a traditional casket, we offer specially made caskets constructed specifically for cremation.
