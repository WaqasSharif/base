                                                        <p>Steve was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, to Command Sgt/Major and Mrs. Guy & Augusta "Gussie" Nadeau. Thereafter, he was raised at Travis Air Force Base, Fairfield, California. He did his formal years of education and graduated with a double major in Humanities and History from California State University, Sacramento, California. He then furthered his course of studies at the Franciscan School of Theology in Berkeley, California, where he successfully completed and achieved his Master's in Divinity and Theology as well as his PhD. He began his formal career in funeral service in 1981. In 1997, he opened his first independently owned funeral home, Nadeau Family Funeral Home in Vacaville, California. He then sold intending on retiring to the upstate of South Carolina. However, Steve was not ready to retire. In 2014, the decision was made with his two business partners to purchase and open a mortuary in Northern Spartanburg County in the community of Chesnee. Between his years of experience and Tommy Harris', they collectively bring close to 60 years serving families with dignity and respect.

After high school he attended Fruitland Baptist Bible Institute and graduated in 1971. He pastored churches in North and South Carolina. Doug is no stranger to the funeral ministry. He has previously worked for the former Johnson Mortuary in Chesnee, Gordon Mortuary in Blacksburg, Shuford-Hatcher Funeral Home in Gaffney and most recently for Eggers Funeral Home of Chesnee. He is married to the former Deborah Robinson and together they have one daughter, Angela. Doug is happy to be a part of the Harris-Nadeau team and looks forward to helping the families who call upon us for their funeral service needs. Doug went home to be with his Lord and Savior on June 19, 2018. He will be dearly missed by our entire staff and the community.</p>
