                                There are several aboveground options available at Perl Funeral Home & Siskiyou Memorial Park. Aboveground burials are an excellent alternative to in-ground burials because they provide a more private resting space for your loved one. Aboveground burials include:

                                We use high-quality materials and construction when we build mausoleums. Your family deserves a dignified resting place that preserves and perpetuates your family's name. We added the Mount Medford Mausoleum to Perl Funeral Home & Siskiyou Memorial Park's grounds in 1935, and it remains in outstanding condition. We offer many options, including both side-by-side and tandem crypts. We design each entombment according to your desires and concerns. We are also constructing the third phase of our Crystal Gardens Mausoleum. To learn more about our mausoleums, give us a call or <a href="">visit us today</a>

                                Endowment Care is one of the biggest reasons we have such a beautiful cemetery. Each family that purchases a cemetery space pays a one-time fee of $100.00. We deposit this small, required fee into an endowment care trust fund. The principle is never touched, but the interest is removed from time to time. The fee pays for grounds care and maintenance. We want to ensure future generations have a resting place that is never overgrown or run down. This fund is why Perl Funeral Home & Siskiyou Memorial Park offers the best burial services and options in Medford, OR.
