                                    <p>“Fortunately my father had made arrangements in advance with Daehler Mortuary in Portsmouth. When he passed away he was 98 and lived in California. As his only child I lived in Colorado and the other members of his family were spread throughout the U.S. When I notified Daehler's of my father's passing, the manager, David Bussa, immediately started taking care of everything making a potentially difficult situation effortless for us. He made arrangements in California for my father's flight to Ohio, made arrangements for all of the necessary certificates, and made sure my father had the casket he had selected. Since my father was a WWII veteran, he made arrangements with the local American Legion Post 23 for a graveside military service as well as engaging a local Priest. David and Daehler's caring and personal touches made this time both beautiful and memorable for all of our family. His loving daughter and family”</p>
