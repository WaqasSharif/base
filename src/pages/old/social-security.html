This benefit, meant to assist with a family’s financial burden of losing the lost loved one’s income, is particularly important for young families with children.
                                                    <br> <br> Monthly benefit amounts are based on the earnings of the person who died. The more they paid into Social Security, the higher your benefits would be. This amount is a percentage of the deceased’s basic Social Security benefit. 
                                                    <br> <br>Additionally, a one-time lump-sum death payment of $255 can be paid to the surviving spouse if he or she is living with the deceased; or if living apart, was receiving certain Social Security benefits on the deceased’s record. When there is no surviving spouse, the payment is made to a child who is eligible for benefits.</p>
