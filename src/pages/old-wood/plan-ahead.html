                    All of your arrangements are guaranteed and will be carried out just as you have directed. You and your family can feel comfortable that although you won’t need the plans for years to come, when they are needed, they will be available and taken care of. There is an immense peace knowing your wishes will be executed as you designed them, meaning those you care about will be able to remember you as you want them to.

                    Sadly, many families experience disputes and hard feelings when arranging for a loved one’s unexpected death. Because memories of the loved one’s wishes sometimes contradict each other, disagreements can easily arise. Such infighting and disunity can drive bitter emotions and damage the healing process. By making your plans now, your loved ones don’t have to guess at what you may have wanted; they will know you were remembered as you wanted to be.

                    When you plan a funeral in advance there are more options when it comes to funding a funeral. Prearrangements can be paid for with a preneed insurance policy, life insurance, or other payment options. At the time of death, services must be paid in full, so it's important to understand your options ahead of time.

                    Did you know that often more than 150 decisions and tasks must be completed within the first 24 to 48 hours after an individual’s passing? By arranging your final wishes ahead of time, you can ensure that your loved ones don’t have to wrestle over those details and decisions during their time of emotional upheaval. The ability to know everything is taken care of will allow proper remembrance and the first steps of healing.

                                Preplanning is merely making your wishes known; however, most families who do this choose to pre-fund their funeral as well. Doing so will relieve the financial burden from your family and offers peace of mind to you.
