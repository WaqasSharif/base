                                    The veterans death benefits help cover the burial, funeral and transportation costs associated with the deceased’s services and disposition. For those being buried in a national cemetery, survivors can receive assistance with the burial and funeral costs, the plot or internment, and the transporting of the veteran’s remains for burial.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    You must file a claim for a non-service-connected burial allowance within two years after the veteran’s burial or cremation. There is no time limit to file for a service-connected burial, plot or interment allowance.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    You can apply online at <a href="#">https://www.va.gov/burials-and-memorials/application/530/introduction</a> or by mail after completing the VA Form 21P-530.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    A veteran who didn’t receive a dishonorable discharge or a service member who died while on active duty may be eligible for a headstone or marker if they meet certain requirements.
