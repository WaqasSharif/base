                            <p>“I do not have enough words to thank Harris-Nadeau. Tommy Harris and all the staff are such wonderful, well organized, compassionate and all together great people to get you through the worst time in your life. From the beginning to the end, they have walked me through this journey. Always patient and loving. Answering all your questions and addressing any concerns. I highly recommend pre-planning if possible. Tommy was so helpful when we mentioned green was Dad’s favorite color. We were able to get a perfect green casket. I know Dad loves it. And to top it off, I just watched the photo slide show and can’t stop crying because it was absolutely beautiful.”</p>

                            <p>“My husband passed after a short fight with lung cancer and pneumonia. I called and spoke with Mr. Nadeau prior to his passing and we scheduled a time to come make arrangements. He was not available when I arrived but Mr. Harris was and he quickly made me feel comfortable & comforted. He took all the info needed to get started with the type of service we wanted. We chose to delay due to the holidays. During this delay in process I never felt pressured to add services, flowers or up-sale anything that I did not want. Mr. Harris gave me books to look at for flowers, urns and showed me all the memorial books to choose from. He would always step away and let us talk it through and decide. I can’t tell you how comforting it is for someone constantly tell you to take your time. After the initial meet, I know I emailed and talked to them what seemed like 100 times with one piece of info at a time. They understood when I explained that I had to process and think about music, dates and even the concern about the engraved urn being delivered in time for the service. There was never a time that a return email or call took more than 2 hrs. Even when emailing in the middle of the night where I had emailed the choices of music, I received a quick reply, I will get this put on CD for the service. If you EVER want the loving touch, calming service that was given to our family and special care of what seemed as if they were caring for their own family please do not hesitate to call Mr Harris and Mr Nadeau because they made our home going for Philip a pleasant lasting memory not a regrettable choice of Mortuaries. Gentlemen, I truly appreciate your time, loving care and support during our stressful time. May God richly bless your lives and business for many years to come. The Family of Philip Raimondo Sr”</p>

They calmly and complexity explained the details of how the process works and offered several options . After having 6 family members agreed they then walked us through every detail and answered each question From the type of services we needed .from the announcement , video, the order of service and everything between they were excellent I have had experiences with many of our local mortuaries professionally as well as working with some within our family .

I honestly do not think I could have planned my brothers funeral without Tommy. When I could not figure things out he was there to help me. I was at the funeral home several times. Not once did Tommy turn me away. He sat with me and helped in anyway he could. We had my brother's service a week ago today and Tommy is still here for me and mine! They are the best!

When we knew that his time here on earth was coming to an end, my sister wanted me to go and start the plans for his burial. I went to Eggers Funeral Home in Chesnee and was absolutely devastated as to how I was treated. Absolutely no compassion at all. The man that waited on me never once mentioned they were sorry for what we were going through and having to prepare for. I asked questions and had to take notes about all the cost. In fact quit rude to say the least. I told my sister and she said go to Harris-Nadeau. ABSOLUTELY the difference between NIGHT and DAY. Mr. Steve Nadeau and Mr. Tommy Harris treated me as if I was a family member. As we started the process I was going to take notes and he immediately said I did NOT have too. I left Harris-Nadeau Mortuary with a port folio in my hand with all the expenses and choices to take to my sister. I highly recommend this Funeral Home. Steve was a blessing to our family. I personally know they have the desire to treat people with RESPECT and do right by them. Thank you so much for the wonderful service you provided to our family during the loss of our loved one”

Tommy Harris and Steve Nadeau offered a personal service that went well beyond our expectations! My mama was treated like a queen and all her worries about daddy's services were quickly relieved after talking and planning everything with Tommy! The mortuary offered top level services and went above and beyond anything we could have ever ask for! From the arrangements to the personal touches, were overwhelming to us! It took us less than an hour to plan everything, in a comfortable environment, without any pressure to do anything that we didn't want. From the Flowers to the Family car, these folks offer a class act service that our town so desperately needs. Thank you all again for your outstanding care and concern.

A time that should be spent celebrating the season with those we love suddenly brings us together to celebrate the loss of a life that we treasured and adored. Having just gone through this during the holidays, it was a welcomed blessing to have Tommy and Steve provide their services to help us during this difficult time. Always available, always professional and always willing to serve, this is why I never hesitate to call on either one! Thank you for being such a blessing during such a difficult time!”
