                            Since we opened on September 20, 2016, we have approached life (and death) differently. While some just see the end of a loved one’s life as a time for grief and mourning, we prefer to think of it as a time for reflection, appreciation and even celebration. This is evident in everything we do, from the way we conduct our services to the amenities we choose to offer. We are not a burial ground. We are a close knit community dedicated to honoring, sharing and preserving the amazing and inspirational stories that are life.
                            <br><br>
                            We've learned a lot over many years. Like how to present options without overwhelming. And how to meet the needs of many caring parties. People come to us in difficult times, and we respond kindness, calmness and expertise. Our goal is to create a beautiful occasion and make you feel welcome, always. We spend our days planning with families. We stay up to date with industry developments. And we make hard times a little easier.

                            On September 20, 2016, our dream of providing quality funeral service at an affordable price became a reality. Between owners, Steven J. Nadeau and Tommy W. Harris, both licensed funeral directors, we have well over 60 years combined experienced in providing what we feel is the finest that funeral service has to offer. In our short time, we have built a reputation that is distinct to our firm. Respectability, personalization and quality is what we are all about and what we provide each family we are privileged to serve.
                            <br><br>
                            What our families are finding out is we strive to provide the finest, staying within the affordable means of each and every family.
                            <br><br>
                            Funeral Services, regardless of traditional with burial or cremation are made to be personal, representing the life of that loved one with long lasting beautiful memories. We strive in our personalized planning of the service to incorporate those survivors who have been touched by the life of the deceased. Family and friends would find a lasting DVD slideshow prepared by one of our trained staff following the storyline of the deceased as told by family members. They might also find personal items representing that loved one’s life that can be directly related.  One might find a beautiful knitted blanket or a set of golf clubs or perhaps a form of art as created by the deceased.
                            <br><br>
                            Through visiting with our families and conversations with them, and building on our trust and service, we can and do provide your family with a long lasting treasured memory that for years will serve as a comforting remembrance. We have many years of service caring for families from all walks of life. We are leaders in funeral service profession dedicating ourselves to superior service and sincerity.
