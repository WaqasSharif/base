                <p>The Suffolk location of R.W. Baker & Co Funeral Home and Crematory is conveniently located in the historic downtown area of the city. Primarily serving families from Suffolk, Isle of Wight and North Carolina, this facility was remodeled in 1999 adding a new chapel, viewing rooms, family room, kids play room and a crematory was added. The massive renovation allowed us to better serve our families with a modern facility and a larger parking lot. This stately building has been the home of the funeral home since 1941 when Robert N. Baker, Jr. purchased the home.</p>

                <p>This location also has small meeting house on the back of the property called the Constancia House. This home originally stood in Cedar Hill Cemetery, but in 1994 Robert N. Baker III organized, with the help of family and friends, and deconstructed the house, moved it into the backyard of the funeral home piece by piece. Currently the building is used by different civic, church, and volunteer organizations as a meeting place. It is also used as a reception hall after funerals.</p>

                <p>On July 24, 2012, originally Purviance Funeral Home, located in Wakefield, VA, was purchased by the Baker family. Our staff is making sure that we provide family to family service that families have relied on for many generations from the Baker and Purviance families. We are very proud to have the Wakefield Chapel as part of our family. This location has been a great addition to our family funeral home.

                <p>Over the past several years, large multi-national organizations have been purchasing funeral homes at an alarming rate. The early nineties saw hundreds of family operated funerals homes across North America brought into the fold of large multi national firms. Recent media reports such as 60 Minutes, Time, and US News and World Report conclude that these death care business operations, while trying to maintain the facade of a family operation, quickly increase prices considerably and enforce merchandising policies on employees geared to significantly increase their bottom lines.</p>

                <p>In 1992, the Baker family, joined with B.W. Foster Funeral Home in Portsmouth to build Baker-Foster Funeral Home to serve the fast growing Northern Suffolk, Chesapeake and Portsmouth areas. The 11,000 square foot building has a large chapel, multiple large viewing rooms and large reception room. This facility is our largest and most user friendly funeral home. Conveniently located between Route 17 and Bennettâ€™s Pasture Road, at 5685 Lee Farm Lane, Suffolk VA, 23435. The Foster's family business began in Portsmouth in 1896 as Flynn & O'Connor Funeral Home, which was acquired by the Fosters in 1936. B.W. Foster Funeral Home is currently operated by Brian P. Foster. In August of 2017 the joint ownership was dissolved and the Baker Family is now the sole owners of Baker-Foster Funeral Home.</p>
