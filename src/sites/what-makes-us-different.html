                <p>R.W. Baker has been family owned by the Bakers since 1885. In a time where many funeral homes have sold out to the international conglomerates and are trying to rebuild themselves, we proudly have remained owned and operated by the descendants of Robert Washington Baker. We are now in our fifth generation of family operation.</p>

                <p>Over the past several years, large multi-national organizations have been purchasing funeral homes at an alarming rate. The early nineties saw hundreds of family operated funerals homes across North America brought into the fold of large multi national firms. Recent media reports such as 60 Minutes, Time, and US News and World Report conclude that these death care business operations, while trying to maintain the facade of a family operation, quickly increase prices considerably and enforce merchandising policies on employees geared to significantly increase their bottom lines.</p>
