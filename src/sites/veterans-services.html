                <p>Albert G. Horton, Jr. Memorial Veterans Cemetery provides outer burial containers for in-ground casketed burials. An outer burial container is an enclosure (made of reinforced concrete with a domed lid, or of steel) in which caskets are placed, which protects the cemetery lawn from sinking down and possibly crushing the casket.</p>
