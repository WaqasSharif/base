                    Ever since we opened our funeral home we have approached life (and death) differently. While some just see the end of a loved one’s life as a time for grief and mourning, we prefer to think of it as a time for reflection, appreciation and even celebration. This is evident in everything we do, from the way we conduct our services to the amenities we choose to offer. We are a close knit community dedicated to honoring, sharing and preserving the amazing and inspirational stories that are life.

                            <p>“My siblings and I buried our father two weeks ago. Ted at Wilkerson Funeral Home did an exemplary job, handling all possible scenarios for our father’s service. They arranged the insurance coverage that paid for everything, the heartfelt obituary, the service with a lovely video montage at the church in Reidsville and Ted personally drove the hearst five hours to Manassas, VA and arranged for the burial with full military honors. Losing one’s parent is a difficult and stressful endeavor. This kind of professional handling of all aspects for our father to be laid to rest, gave us the peace of mind during a difficult time. The integrity and thoughtfulness with which Ted and Wilkerson performed their duties was a God send for us. Bless them and we give them our highest recommendation.”</p>

I cannot emphasize enough the quality and integrity they displayed through this very emotional and difficult time. Ted Hopkins was the consummate professional, who directed the organization of the services flawlessly from start to finish. We will be forever grateful for the compassion and professionalism they showed our family and friends.”</p>

                            <p>“In 2014 after a two year fight with cancer my husband took his final breath and left this world. Even though we had known this day was coming I was in a complete state of shock. The only thing that I knew for certain was that I wanted the Wilkerson "family" to be the ones to prepare his arrangements. I had seen the care and compassion that they had shown my husband and his family when his mom passed in 1997 and I felt they were the right fit for us. I was right. I couldn't have asked for a better, more caring group of people. I was met at the hospice center by someone from Wilkerson (I'm so sorry I can't remember anyone who I spoke with during those days--I was in such a deep depression and fog) and he gently led me through the beginning of what I would need to do. Later at the funeral home I was once again led gently through the rest of the process. My concerns about certain matters were quickly eased and I was shown that I and my family aren't just packages to be sold. I was made to feel that my family and myself were a part of their family and that they made every effort to put our hearts at ease and took care of all those "little details" that most people wouldn't bother to do. At the hardest time in my life I was shown care, empathy, compassion and respect by those who didn't know me from anyone. I will always direct people facing the death of a loved one to go to Wilkerson. Their empathy and respect for those under their care (not just those who have passed but those of us left behind) is above reproach and I would never recommend anyone else. Thank you Wilkerson Funeral Home for all that you do.”</p>
