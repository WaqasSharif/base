                    <p>At your convenience, you can meet with a member of our staff to discuss your options and your preferences.

                    <p>There are many advantages when you take care of your final arrangements in advance. The most obvious benefit is financial, but there are a number of emotional benefits, too. When you make arrangements in advance you have a better opportunity to make informed choices. If you decide to prepay, you guarantee today's prices, and can take advantage of affordable payment plans. We can provide additional professional advice on pre-planning and prepaying.</p>

                    <p>When you pre-plan, you do not need to pay for everything in advance, your estate can pay for the services at the rates being charged when your funeral is held. When your plan is complete, the funeral director will keep it on file until it is needed. However, if you pre-pay at the time you make your pre-arrangements, you can lock in today's prices. We offer several affordable payment and investment options. We'll be happy to discuss these options with you and help you make a decision that best suits your needs.</p>

                            A Revocable Trust is a trust that any amount of money may be deposited into. At anytime, you may ask for this money and the interest it has made. At the end of the year you will receive a 1099 statement on which you must pay taxes on the interest as it is considered income.

                            An Irrevocable Trust is most commonly purchased by someone who eventually might need care in excess of his or her assets. Once purchased, it can be used for burial purposes only. This trust can be started for any amount. It may be added to at any time. You will receive a 1099 at the end of the year showing total interest earned.
