                            <p>Ever since we opened our funeral home we have approached life (and death) differently. While some just see the end of a loved one’s life as a time for grief and mourning, we prefer to think of it as a time for reflection, appreciation and even celebration. This is evident in everything we do, from the way we conduct our services to the amenities we choose to offer. We are a close knit community dedicated to honoring, sharing and preserving the amazing and inspirational stories that are life.

                                We have years of experience caring for families, from all walks of life. Each family comes to us because they know we are leaders in our profession, dedicated to excellence in service, and have the highest integrity.</p>

                                <p>“Fortunately my father had made arrangements in advance with Daehler Mortuary in Portsmouth. When he passed away he was 98 and lived in California. As his only child I lived in Colorado and the other members of his family were spread throughout the U.S. When I notified Daehler's of my father's passing, the manager, David Bussa, immediately started taking care of everything making a potentially difficult situation effortless for us. He made arrangements in California for my father's flight to Ohio, made arrangements for all of the necessary certificates, and made sure my father had the casket he had selected. Since my father was a WWII veteran, he made arrangements with the local American Legion Post 23 for a graveside military service as well as engaging a local Priest. David and Daehler's caring and personal touches made this time both beautiful and memorable for all of our family. His loving daughter and family”</p>
